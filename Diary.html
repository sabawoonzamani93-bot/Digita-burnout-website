Diary
During this project, I designed and developed a multi-page website about digital burnout and screen fatigue in young adults aged 16–25. I chose this topic because excessive screen use has become a major issue affecting students’ sleep, concentration, and mental health.

The first stage of development involved planning the structure of the website. I created a flat site structure to ensure easy navigation and user-friendly access to information. I designed five main pages: Home, What is Digital Burnout, Causes & Symptoms, Health Effects, and Prevention. I also included a development diary page to document the process.

I then created a storyboard to visualise the layout of each page. I ensured each page had a consistent navigation bar, clear headings, and readable content. This consistency improves usability and accessibility for users.

During development, I used HTML to structure the content and CSS to style the website. HTML allowed me to organise text using headings, paragraphs, lists, and hyperlinks. CSS was used to improve the visual appearance by applying colours, spacing, and layout consistency.

One challenge I faced was ensuring the site looked clean and readable. Initially, the text looked crowded, so I adjusted margins and line spacing using CSS. I also improved navigation styling to make buttons more visible.

To increase interactivity, I added a short quiz using JavaScript to help users assess symptoms of screen fatigue. This interactive feature makes the website more engaging and meets the requirement for dynamic content.

Testing was an important part of development. I checked that all navigation links worked correctly, pages loaded properly, and the quiz function worked without errors. I also tested readability and layout on different screen sizes.

After testing, I improved the website by simplifying text, improving colour contrast, and ensuring consistent formatting across pages.

This project improved my skills in HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript. I also learned the importance of planning, testing, and user-centred design when developing a website.

Overall, the website successfully meets its purpose of educating young adults about digital burnout while providing clear prevention strategies and interactive learning.
