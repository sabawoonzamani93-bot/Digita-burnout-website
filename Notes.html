Development Notes

The purpose of this website is to educate young adults aged 16–25 about digital burnout and screen fatigue. This audience was chosen because young people are among the highest users of smartphones, social media, and digital devices. The website provides information about causes, symptoms, health effects, and prevention strategies to promote digital wellbeing.

Several factors influence the performance of a website. One major factor is internet speed. Users with slow connections may experience delays when loading pages, especially if images are large. To improve performance, images should be compressed and unnecessary media avoided. Another factor is device performance. The website must function on mobile phones, tablets, and computers. Using simple layouts and optimised code helps ensure compatibility across devices. Browser compatibility is also important, so the website was tested in common browsers to ensure consistent display.

Code efficiency also affects performance. Clean HTML and CSS reduce loading time and improve readability. Excessive scripts and heavy styling can slow down a site, so only essential features were included.

Security is an important consideration in website development. If a website collects user data through forms, it must protect personal information. Although this website does not collect sensitive data, developers must consider secure hosting and HTTPS encryption to prevent data interception. Protection from malware and unauthorised access is also important for maintaining website integrity.

There are also legal constraints that must be considered. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires websites to protect user privacy and clearly explain how data is used. If forms are added in the future, a privacy policy would be required. Copyright laws must also be respected when using images or content. Only royalty-free images or properly referenced sources should be used. Accessibility requirements must also be considered to ensure that users with disabilities can access the website. This includes readable fonts, clear colour contrast, and simple navigation.

Ethical considerations are important because the website discusses health information. Content must be accurate, non-misleading, and should encourage users to seek professional help when necessary.

Overall, performance, security, legal compliance, and ethical responsibility are essential factors in developing an effective and trustworthy website.
